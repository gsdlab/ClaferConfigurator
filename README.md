ClaferConfigurator
==================

v0.3.3.14.4.2013

An interactive, web-based, configurator for attributed feature models with inheritance subset of Clafer.

### Background

[Clafer](http://clafer.org) is a general-purpose lightweight structural modeling language developed at [GSD Lab](http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/), [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca). Clafer can be used for *product-line modeling* and *multi-objective optimization*, whereby a the model of a product line can be used to find optimal products given a set of optimization goals. 

### Functions

1. Provides a web based GUI for interaction with claferIG.
2. Allows to compare and analyze product configurations.
3. Facilitates configuration of clafer models.

### Nature

The ClaferConfigurator is a web-based application. Its server side (implemented with Node.JS) only runs Clafer and ClaferIG and passes back its output.
The client-side is implemented using Javascript/HTML and handles all the basic functionality.

### Live demo

This is an experimental installation of the tool. We'll try best to keep it up; however, it does occasionally crash. When that happens, please email [Michal Antkiewicz](mailto:mantkiew@gsd.uwaterloo.ca).

Getting Clafer Tools
--------------------

Binary distributions of Clafer, ClaferIG, and ClaferWiki for Windows, Mac, and Linux, can be downloaded from [Clafer Tools - Binary Distributions](http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/node/516). 
Clafer Wiki requires Haskell Platform and MinGW to run on Windows. 

In case these binaries do not work on your particular machine configuration, the tools can be easily built from source code, as described below.

The following tools are not part of the binary distribution and they have to be downloaded separately:

* [ClaferMOO](https://github.com/gsdlab/ClaferMooStandalone) is a set of scripts in Python (cross-platform). 
* [ClaferMooVisualizer](https://github.com/gsdlab/ClaferMooVisualizer) is a client/server web application written JavaScript.
* ClaferConfigurator is a client/server web application written JavaScript.

### Dependencies for running

* [Java Platform (JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) v6+, 32bit
* [Python](http://www.python.org/download/) v2.7.*
  * Needed by ClaferMOO
* [Clafer](https://github.com/gsdlab/clafer) v0.3.2
  * can be from the binary distribution
* [ClaferIG](https://github.com/gsdlab/claferIG) v0.3.2
  * can be from the binary distribution
* [Node.JS Framework](http://nodejs.org/download/) v0.10.4

### Installation

1. Install [ClaferIG](https://github.com/gsdlab/claferIG)
  * Clafer is installed as part of this procedure
2. Ensure that both clafer and claferIG are on your system path
3. Download the [ClaferConfigurator](https://github.com/gsdlab/ClaferConfigurator) to some directory `<target directory>`
4. Go to `<target directory>/ClaferConfigurator/Server/` and exectue the command:
	
 `npm install`

### Settings

1. Make sure the port `5003` is free, or change the variable value in `server.js`:
`var port = 5003;` to any free one. This will be moved to the configuration settings file later.

2. Make sure `clafer`, `claferIG` `node`, and `java` are in `PATH` environment variables, so they can be executed without any path prefixes.

Running the following commands should produce the following results or later version:

`clafer -V` 

> `Clafer v0.3.2.11-4-2013`

`python -V`

> `Python 2.7.3`

`java -version`

> `java version 1.7.0_17`
> `Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_17-b02)`
> `Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.7-b01, mixed mode)`

`node -v`

>v0.10.4

3. Make sure `uploads` folder is accessible for writing, since temporary files will be stored there.

### Running

To run the server execute
	
`node server.js`
 
from `<target directory>/ClaferConfigurator/Server/`

Then you can go to any browser and type `http://localhost:[port]/` and open ClaferIG compatible model (limited to attributed feature models with inheritance subset of Clafer).
